            <h2>Causes of type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>In type 2 diabetes, there are several reasons why the pancreas doesn't produce enough insulin.</p>
<hr>
<h2 >Risk factors for type 2 diabetes</h2>
<p>Three of the main risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes are:</p>
<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:disc">
<li>age – being over the age of 40 (over 25 for people of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean or black African origin, even if you were born in the UK)   </li>
<li>genetics – having a close relative with the condition, such as a parent, brother or sister </li>
<li>weight – being overweight or obese </li>
</ul>
<p>People of south Asian and African-Caribbean origin also have an increased risk of developing complications of diabetes, such as heart disease, at a younger age than the rest of the population.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes increases with age. This may be because people tend to gain weight and exercise less as they get older.</p>
<p>Maintaining a healthy weight by eating a healthy, balanced diet and exercising regularly are ways of preventing and managing diabetes.</p>
<p>White people over the age of 40 have an increased risk of developing the condition. People of south Asian, Chinese, African-Caribbean and black African origin have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes at a much earlier age.</p>
<p>However, despite increasing age being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, over recent years younger people from all ethnic groups have been developing the condition.</p>
<p>It's also becoming more common for children – as young as seven in some cases – to develop type 2 diabetes.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Genetics</h3>
<p>Genetics is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Your risk of developing the condition is increased if you have a close relative such as a parent, brother or sister who has the condition. </p>
<p>The closer the relative, the greater the risk. A child who has a parent with type 2 diabetes has about a one in three chance of also developing the condition.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Being overweight or obese</h3>
<p>You're more likely to develop type 2 diabetes if you're overweight or obese.</p>
<p>For most people in the UK, a body mass index (BMI) of:</p>
<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:disc">
<li>25 or above puts you in the overweight range </li>
<li>30 or above puts you in the obese range </li>
</ul>
<p>However, some groups have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes:</p>
<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:disc">
<li>Asians with a BMI score of 23 or more are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes </li>
<li>Asians with a BMI of 27.5 or more are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes </li>
</ul>
<p>Fat around your tummy (abdomen) particularly increases your risk. This is because it releases chemicals that can upset the body's cardiovascular and metabolic systems.</p>
<p>This increases your risk of developing a number of serious conditions, including: </p>
<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:disc">
<li>coronary heart disease</li>
<li>stroke</li>
<li>some types of cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>Measuring your waist is a quick way of assessing your diabetes risk. This is a measure of abdominal <a href="/conditions/Obesity/Pages/Introduction.aspx">obesity</a>, which is a particularly high-risk form of obesity.</p>
<p>Some groups have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, based on their waist measurements:</p>
<ul class="w3-leftbar w3-theme-border" style="list-style:disc">
<li>women with a waist size of 80cm (31.5 inches) or more </li>
<li>Asian men with a waist size of 89cm (35 inches) or more </li>
<li>white or black men with a waist size of 94cm (37 inches) or more </li>
</ul>
<p>Use the BMI calculator to find out if you're a healthy weight for your height.</p>
<p>Exercising regularly and reducing your body weight by about 5% could reduce your risk of getting diabetes by more than 50%.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Other risks</h3>
<p>Your risk of developing type 2 diabetes is also increased if your blood glucose level is higher than normal, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with diabetes.</p>
<p>This is sometimes called pre-diabetes, and doctors sometimes call it impaired fasting glycaemia (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT).</p>
<p>Pre-diabetes can progress to type 2 diabetes if you don't take preventative steps, such as making lifestyle changes. These include eating healthily, losing weight if you're overweight, and taking plenty of regular exercise.</p>
